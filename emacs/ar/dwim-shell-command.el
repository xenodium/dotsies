  "Execute DWIM shell command asynchronously using noweb templates.

Which files

  `dwim-shell-command' attempts to guess which file(s) you may want
  the command to operate on.

  1. If visiting a `dired' buffer, draw the marked file(s).
  2. If visiting any other buffer with an associated file, use that.

Templates

  Operate on drawn files using either the following:

    <<f>> (file path)
    <<fne>> (file path without extension)
    <<e>> (extension)
    <<td>> (generate a temporary directory)
    <<*>> (all files joined)

  For example:

    With drawn files '(\"path/to/image1.png\" \"path/to/image2.png\")

   \"convert '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'\" expands to

     \"convert 'path/to/image1.png' 'path/to/image1.jpg'\"
     \"convert 'path/to/image2.png' 'path/to/image2.jpg'\"

   while \"ls -lh <<*>>\" expands to

     \"ls -lh path/to/image1.png path/to/image2.png\"

Focus

  `dwim-shell-command' creates a process buffer to capture command
  output, but doesn't display or focus on it by default.  Instead,
  it tries to guess what's more convenient to focus on.

  While the process is busy, show a spinner in the minibuffer.  No
  focus changes.

  After process is finished:

  1. If there were any files created in the `default-directory',
  jump to a `dired' buffer and move point to the new file (via
  `dired-jump').

  2. If no new files were created, automatically switch focus to the
  process buffer and display its output.

    Note: You can prevent this automatic focus by prepending your
    command with whitespace.

      |
      V
    \" convert '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'\"

  3. If the shell command caused any errors, offer to focus the
  process buffer and display its output.

Quick exit

  Process buffers are read-only and can be quickly closed by
  pressing `q'."

:FILES are used to instantiate SCRIPT as a noweb template.

  The following are supported:

    <<f>> (file path)
    <<fne>> (file path without extension)
    <<e>> (extension)
    <<td>> (generate a temporary directory)
    <<*>> (all files joined)

  For example:

    Given :FILES '(\"path/to/image1.png\" \"path/to/image2.png\")

    \"convert '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'\" expands to

      \"convert 'path/to/image1.png' 'path/to/image1.jpg'\"
      \"convert 'path/to/image2.png' 'path/to/image2.jpg'\"

    and \"ls -lh <<*>>\" expands to

      \"ls -lh path/to/image1.png path/to/image2.png\"

:EXTENSIONS ensures that all files in :FILES have the given
extensions.  Can be either single string \"png\" or a list '(\"png\" \"jpg\").

:SHELL-UTIL and :SHELL-ARGS can be used to specify SCRIPT interpreter.

  For python, use:

    (dwim-shell-command-execute-script
       \"Print Pi\"
       \"import math
         print math.pi\"
       :shell-util \"python\"
       :shell-args \"-c\")

:SHELL-PIPE can be used to pipe SCRIPT to it

  For swift, use:

    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       \"Print Pi\"
       \"print(Double.pi)\"
       :shell-pipe \"swift -\")

:UTILS ensures that all needed command line utilities are installed.
Can be either a single string \"ffmpeg\" or a list '(\"ffmpet\" \"convert\").

:POST-PROCESS-TEMPLATE enables processing template further after noweb
instantiation.

:ON-COMPLETION is invoked after SCRIPT executes (disabling DWIM
internal behavior).

:SILENT-SUCCESS to avoid jumping to process buffer if neither error
 nor file generated."
